## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- Bike Sharing dataset is being used from https://ml-course2-upgrad.s3.amazonaws.com/Linear+Regression+Assignment/Bike+Sharing+Assignment/day.csv

## Conclusions
- There is a positive correlation between feeling temperature and the rental demand. 
- We noticed a rise in demand for rentals from 2018 to 2019. That means the demand will rise in future as COVID-19 lockdown releases.
- Rainy, Misty days are bad for rentals as the demand is negatively correlated with Rain/Mist
- When the feeling temperature is about 30 degrees Celcius and weather is clear, it will be best time for rentals.
